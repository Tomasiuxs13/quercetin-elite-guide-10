            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              At QBestSupplements, our mission is to cut through the noise and provide you with clear, 
              trustworthy, and research-backed information about quercetin supplements. We believe that 
              everyone deserves access to high-quality health products without the confusion of marketing 
              hype or misleading claims.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
              Founded in 2023 by a team of health enthusiasts, nutritionists, and research analysts, 
              QBestSupplements grew from our own frustration with the supplement industry. We found it 
              challenging to identify truly effective quercetin products among the sea of options, each 
              making bold claims without substantial evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our team brings together expertise in nutrition science, biochemistry, and consumer advocacy. 
              We're not just reviewers â€“ we're consumers who understand the importance of making informed 
              health decisions.
            </p>
